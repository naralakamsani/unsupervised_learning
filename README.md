# Unsupervised Learning
    Narasimha Lakamsani - nlakamsani3@gatech.edu
This project implements five supervised learning algorithms: Decision Tree, K-nearest Neighbors, boosting, support vector machines, and neural networks. These algorithms are evaluated on 2 different datasets.

### Datasets
* Dataset#1: Bike Sharing Demand Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bike-sharing-demand/overview
* Dataset#2: Hotel Reservations Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsan81/hotel-reservations-classification-dataset?select=Hotel+Reservations.csv

### Run Code Instuctions
* open collab notebook with models for dataset#1:  https://colab.research.google.com/github/naralakamsani/unsupervised_learning/blob/main/bike_sharing_demand_unsupervised.ipynb
* open collab notebook with models for dataset#2:  https://colab.research.google.com/github/naralakamsani/unsupervised_learning/blob/main/reservation_retention_unsupervised.ipynb
* Click on the runtime option above. Then proceed to click run all to run the entire notebook
* note: It might take a while to finish running the whole notebooks, so it might be ideal to run only a few desired focused cells
